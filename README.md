## Description

Project Overview: Z-Test for Identifying Target Market
Objective: Perform a Z-test to compare two customer segments (e.g., a test group and a control group) to identify the target market based on key metrics such as conversion rate, spending patterns, or any other relevant measure.

### Steps:
Data Collection: Gather test group and control group data (e.g., two customer segments' average spendings).

Hypothesis Setup:
Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference between the means of the two groups.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The mean of the test group is significantly larger than the control group.

Perform Z-Test using the ztest method from statsmodels.
Result Interpretation: Based on the Z-test, decide if there is a significant difference that helps identify the target market.
